Eugene has a natural inclination towards working with data and was able to drive business value through data analytics. He is an avid student of data science, consistently improving his skills in math, data mining, algorithms, and R. Being analytical and quick on the uptake, he settled into projects rapidly, suggested new data analysis tools that improved team efficiency, and gleaned valuable insights from the data. He has strong personal management skills and can manage multiple assignments effectively.  Working with Eugene in projects, I find him a strong team player and enjoyable to work with--He will be a valuable asset to any organization.
