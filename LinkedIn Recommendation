Eugene is an avid learner of data science and is consistently improving his skills in R, data mining techniques, algorithms, mathematics, and statistics.  He is creative in being able to drive value through data analytics. Being highly analytical and a fast learner, Eugene ramped up quickly in a data integration project when he first started, contributing much improvements within a week.  He introduced new data analysis tools and processes, improving the overall efficiency of getting work done and provided valuable insights on the data. He has strong personal management skills and is able to manage multiple tasks and assignments effectively.  Working with Eugene in projects, I find him a strong team player and enjoyable to work with.  He will definitely be a highly valuable asset to any organization.
